Data Upload
=========================================

To utilize the images generated by the active learning pipeline, they must be converted into subject sets that can be uploaded to Zooniverse for labeling.

Creating a Subject Set
----------------------

The following Python function demonstrates how to create a new subject set linked to a specified project:

.. code-block:: python

   def create_subject_set(subject_set_name):
       """
       Creates a new subject set linked to the specified project.

       Args:
           subject_set_name (string): The name of the uploaded subject set.

       Returns:
           subject_set: A new subject set instance that has been saved to the Panoptes platform.
       """
       subject_set = SubjectSet()
       project = Project.find(project_id)
       print(f"Project with project id: {project}")
       subject_set.links.project = project
       subject_set.display_name = subject_set_name
       subject_set.save()
       return subject_set

Usage Example
-------------

To establish a connection to the Zooniverse backend and generate a subject set:

.. code-block:: python

   Panoptes.connect(username='your_username', password='your_password')
   subject_set = create_subject_set('your_subject_set_name')
